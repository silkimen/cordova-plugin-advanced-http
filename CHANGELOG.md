- Change #29: removed "validateDomainName" (see info notice)
- Fixed #31: request fails throwing error on erroneous cookies
- Fixed #28: added support for content type "application/hal+json" on iOS (thanks ryandegruyter)

#### Important information
We've decided to remove the `validateDomainName()` method, because people were complaining that `acceptAllCerts(true)` is not behaving as expected. And also it's not a good idea to disable domain name validation while using valid certs, because it pretends having a secure connection, but it isn't.

You should either use valid certs with domain name validation enabled (safe for production use) or accept any certs without domain name validation (only for private dev environments). I strongly discourage using fake certs in public networks.

Therefore we are disabling domain name validation automatically, when you set `acceptAllCerts(true)`. So if you were using `validateDomainName()` function, you need to remove this function call for v1.6.2+.
